This is the **Uploader** web application.

This is a prototype and proof of concept of the **Uploader** application. In
this version, the server and client are combined into one.

Uploader lets you quickly write sentences, or upload files for others to quickly
look at or download. All sentences and files uploaded are temporary, and get
automatically deleted after a specified amount of time. 

Its an easy way to share notes and files between different people.

To compile, please make sure you have [Libonion](https://github.com/davidmoreno/onion)
installed.
